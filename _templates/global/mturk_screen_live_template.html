Participants are needed for a Virginia Tech Economics Laboratory research study IRB: 22-124.
      </p>
<p>This is a pre-screening survey to determine participant availability for a forthcoming market experiment conducted
    by the VT Econ Lab at Virginia Tech University.  This research studies how market institutions affect asset
    prices.</p>
<p>
To ensure enough participation, we are running this survey to determine availability of mturk members.
    You will be shown a list of potential timeslots and will be asked to indicate which ones you will be able to
    attend.   If we can run an experimental session during a timeslot for which you are available, we will invite
    you to participate in that session.
</p>
<p>This survey should take no more than <b>5 minutes</b> to complete, for which you will be paid <b>$0.25</b>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please write to the organizers of this experiment through the mturk messaging system.
    Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
