    <p>You will also be allowed to sell more stock than you own.  This is called short selling.
        To do this, create SELL orders for more shares than you own.  If all shares are sold, your STOCK
        position will be negative.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <p>You own 4 shares of STOCK and issue a SELL order for 5 shares at some price.
            If you sell all shares, your STOCK position will be -1. </p>
    </div>
    <p>If your STOCK position becomes negative, you will have to pay out dividends.
        To continue the above example, suppose the dividend payment is 100 points per share.
        You will then be charged 100 points.</p>
