    During each round, you will have the opportunity to place orders to BUY or SELL shares of STOCK.  An order
        consists of the order type (BUY or SELL), the number of shares desired and the price at which you are
        willing to BUY or SELL.    </p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>BUY 4 shares at a price of 18.00 ECU</p>
            <p>Or more compactly:</p>
            <p>BUY 4 @ 18.00</p>
        </div>
<p>
A BUY order sets a maximum price you are willing to pay.  That is, entering the above order indicates
    that you are willing to BUY 4 shares of STOCK at a price of 18.00 ECU or below, but you will not be willing
    to BUY at a price greater than 18.00 ECU.
</p>
<p>
A SELL order indicates a minimum price.  So, entering “SELL 3 @ 20.00” means that you are
    willing to SELL at any price 20.00 ECU or greater, but that you are not willing to sell at a price less than 20.00 ECU.
