        <p>In this experiment, you will be allowed to borrow CASH to purchase STOCK. &nbsp;&nbsp; This happens when you enter a BUY order that costs more than the amount of CASH you have. &nbsp;&nbsp; If you borrow, your CASH debt will appear as a negative amount.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
        <p>You have 5000 in CASH and enter the order (BUY 6 shares at 1000 points). &nbsp;&nbsp; This order will potentially cost you 6000 points. &nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving you with a CASH balance of -1000 points.</p>
        </div>

        <p> If your CASH balance becomes negative, you will be charged 5% interest. &nbsp;&nbsp; To continue the above example, at the end of the market period, you will be charged 1000 * 5% = 20 points in interest. &nbsp;&nbsp; This will bring your CASH balance to -1020 points.
