        In this experiment, the system will limit short sales to {{ float_ratio_cap }} of the STOCK that is available
        to trade (this is called the "float"). &nbsp;&nbsp; This limit applies to the whole market, so if you attempt to
        short the STOCK and others have already shorted {{ float_ratio_cap }} of the float, your order
        will be canceled. &nbsp;&nbsp; The Market Page will inform you of the proportion of shorted STOCK.

        <div class="example">
            <p>Suppose there are 10 shares of STOCK available to trade, and two other traders have already
            shorted the STOCK by 5 shares each. &nbsp;&nbsp; This means that 100% of the STOCK float has been shorted.
            If you attempt to sell one share short, that order will be canceled.</p>
