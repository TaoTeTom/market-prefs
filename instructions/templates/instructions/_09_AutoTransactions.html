        Borrowing CASH and shorting STOCK can both be considered a type of debt.  You are borrowing something that
        you will have to payback later.  The debt you take on is subject to a limit.  That limit depends on
        your CASH and STOCK holdings and the current market price.  If you take on debt, your borrowing limit will
        be shown on the screen.
    </p>
        <p>If your debt exceeds your borrowing limit the system will submit an order automatically on your behalf
        to bring your debt back to with in your limit.   If your debt comes from borrowing CASH, then this
        we will try to sell off STOCK to raise CASH.   If your debt comes from shorting STOCK, we will try to
        BUY shares.  Be careful, automatic buys can happen at very high prices, and automatic sells at very low
        prices.</p>
