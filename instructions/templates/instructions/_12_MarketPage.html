        <p>This is the Market page. &nbsp;&nbsp; At the top are the current period and your CASH and STOCK amounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;
            The graph on the right shows the marketâ€™s price and volume history. &nbsp;&nbsp;
            On the left, is the form to submit orders. &nbsp;&nbsp; To enter an order, complete the form and click the
            <span class="btn-look-alike">Submit</span> button.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            If the order is valid, it will appear in the Outstanding Orders box below.</p>
        <p>The middle portion of the screen is for messages and other information. &nbsp;&nbsp;
            Here, you will find information like the time remaining until the market period closes,
            the current market price, and warnings of automatic BUYS or SELLS.
        </p>
        <p>After {{ market_time }} seconds, this page will automatically advance to the Forecasting page.</p>
