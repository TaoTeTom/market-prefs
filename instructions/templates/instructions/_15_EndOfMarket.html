        <p>The market will run for {{ num_rounds }} periods.  Afterward you will be presented with a final
            summary page that will show you final holdings of CASH and STOCK and your final payment.</p>
        <p>As part of the final amount of CASH, the experiment will pay out {{ fund_value }} points for each
            share of STOCK that you own.   If you finish the market with a short position (negative shares),
            you will be charged {{ fund_value }} points per share.
        </p>
        <p>Your final amount of CASH will be converted to actual payment.
            You will be paid 1 US dollar for each {{ conversion }} points of CASH
            that you hold.</p>
        <p>Following the final summary page will be a short survey.</p>
