        <p>At the end of {{ num_rounds }} periods of trading, each unit of STOCK is bought back
            for 14.00 CASH.  If you end the experiment with negative shares (a short position) 14.00
            CASH will be deducted from your CASH for every share short.  Additionally, any forecast rewards earned
            throughout the experiment will be included at this time.
        </p>
        <p>After that your experiment CASH units are converted to US dollars at a rate of 100 CASH = $1 USD,
            to determine
            how much you will be paid at the end of the experiment.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <p>Suppose that at the end of the experiment you have 120 units of CASH and 5 shares of STOCK, and
            the dividend is 0.40 per unit of STOCK.  Your CASH will be updated to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest Payment:  120.00 x 5% = 6.00</li>
                <li>Dividend Payment:  5 x 0.40 = 2.00</li>
                <li>STOCK buy back: 5 x 14.00 = 170.00</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your final CASH amount is then, 120 + 6 + 8 + 70 = 198 units of CASH.</p>
            <p>This will be converted to a bonus payment of $1.98 USD.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Notice:
        that keeping CASH will earn a return (5% per period) and using CASH to buy units of STOCK will also
        yield dividend earnings. If you are trying to earn the most money you might think about whether
            keeping CASH or buying STOCK creates more earnings.</p>
