        <p>At the end of {{ num_rounds }} periods of trading, each unit of STOCK is automatically traded in
            for {{ fund_value }} ECU.  If you end the experiment with negative shares (a short position)
            {{ fund_value }} ECU will be deducted from your CASH for every share short.
        </p>
        <p>After that, your experiment CASH units are converted to US dollars at a rate of 100 ECU = $1 USD,
            to determine
            how much you will be paid at the end of the experiment.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <p>Suppose that at the end of the experiment you have 100 ECU of CASH and 5 shares of STOCK, and
            the dividend is 1.00 per unit of STOCK.  Your CASH will be updated to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest Payment:  100.00 x 5% = 5.00 ECU</li>
                <li>Dividend Payment:  5 x 1.00 = 5.00 ECU</li>
                <li>STOCK buy back: 5 x 14.00 = 70.00 ECU</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your final CASH amount is then, 100 + 5 + 5 + 70 = 180 ECU.</p>
            <p>This will be converted to a bonus payment.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Notice:
        that keeping CASH will earn a return (5% per period) and using CASH to buy units of STOCK will also
        yield dividend earnings. If you are trying to earn the most money you might think about whether
            keeping CASH or buying STOCK creates more earnings.</p>
